  <a id="overview"> </a>
  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">(CAREER) OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p>I'm originally from Nagoya, Japan. After several years in the industry in my home town, I decided to go to the US to go to a university.
  	Since then, my life started to diverge to an unexpected direction.
  	I've been living outside of Japan for many years more than half of my lifetime.
    I've spent ~30 years in the mobile telecom industry as an enginner, then decided to change to academia.
    Along the way, I did a lot of things, saw a lot of things, and learned a lot of things.
    I've met and worked with a lot of people from many different countries.
    Accumulation of all those life experience shaped me to what I am today...
  </p>

  <a id="work_history_experience"> </a>
  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">WORK HISTORY/EXPERIENCE</h2>
  <p>I have been pursuing a career as an engineer in telecom industry throughout my career, almost entirely in the mobile systems in the infrastructure product development space.
    My career trajectory includes several different companies in several different countries in the past.
    Some of the changes were intentional, some were rather side effect and consequence of various life events. <!--- sometimes you have to choose what is (more) important in life.-->
    The types of companies include both multi-national large companies as well as small start-up companies (I have seen and gained insights in both pros and cons of both types of environments as a result).
    I've done almost all types of engineering work associated with the lifecycle of telecom infra system/product development, starting from next-generation system design, architecture, requirement specification, software development, testing, system integration, deployment, and customer support.
  </p>
  <p>Another rather large part of my career is my involvement in standardization such as <a href="https://www.3gpp.org">3GPP</a> for well over 10 years.
  	Reading standard specification documents is not so trivial due to their contents and the way they are written.
  	Due to my long-time involvement with 3GPP, I have gained intricate understanding and knowledge of creating standard specifications, such as why they are written in such complex and not-so-easy-to-digest manner.
  	Due to this, digesting them has become a relatively not-too-difficult task.
  </p>
  <p>Aside from this (and more than anything else) working in different countries and cultures, and having (ex-)colleagues from many different countries with different cultural backgrounds were the most important and precious intangible asset for me.
    Relatively recently, I decided to pursue and obtained a PhD (a long story). I'm currently continuing research work and some teaching in academia environment.
    This experience in non-industry environment gave me yet new different perspectives.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">EDUCATION</h2>
  <p>
  My education and career progression ended up highly convoluted (please see the figure above).
  It was not intentional. It was rather an end result of career-long endeavour to undo my prior (poor) decision to not pursue higher education when I was a teenager.
  You can call it a entire-career-long quest for repechage (2nd chance) in life.
  It's not the optimal way of doing things, but I'm happy that I've done this.
  Having said this, I'm don't quite recommend doing it this way to anybody.

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">RESEARCH WORK</h2>
  <p>My research interest is in communication security.
  	I found vehicular communication (V2X) an interesting research area as it is an intersection of communication industry and automotive industry,
  	and I was curious to see if this relatively-new technology will be a great success in the marketplace or a failure.
  	I have not yet reached conclusion on this point.
  </p>
  <p>
  I did my PhD in 2023 in Katholiek Universiteit in Leuven (KU Leuven) in Beligum.
  My thesis is regarding security and privacy of vehicular communication.
  This work revolves around analysis of standard specifications.
  </p>

  	<li>Security and privacy of communication systems, including vehicular communication (V2X), Cooperative Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM)</li>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">概要</h2>
  <p>吉澤と申します。名古屋出身です。就職後数年間地元でソフトウェア開発の世界に身を置いた後、大学進学のためにアメリカへ渡ることを決めました。
それ以来、人生の半分以上にあたる長い年月を、日本国外で過ごしてきました。約30年間、モバイル通信業界でエンジニアとして従事した後、心機一転アカデミックの世界への転身をし、
博士の学位を取得しました。
その過程に於いて、様々なことを経験し、多くのものを見て、多くのことを学びました。複数の国で仕事をし、多くの国々の人々と出会い、共に仕事をしてきました。
今の自分はこうした人生経験の積み重ねの結果であると考えます。
  </p>

  <a id="work_history_experience-jp"> </a>
  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">職歴</h2>
  <p>私は一貫して通信業界の世界で技術職としての経験を重ね、複数の国の様々な企業でほぼ一貫してモバイルシステムのインフラ製品開発分野に携わってきました。
    勤務先は多国籍大手企業から小規模スタートアップまで多岐にわたり、その結果多様な環境での貴重な経験をいたしました。
職務内容は、次世代システム設計、アーキテクチャ、仕様の策定、ソフトウェア開発、テスト、システム統合、導入、顧客サポートに至るまで、
通信インフラシステム／製品開発ライフサイクルに関連するほぼ全てのエンジニアリング業務を経験しました。
  </p>
  <p>今までに携わった技術職としてのもう一つの別の部分として、10年以上にもわたる<a href="https://www.3gpp.org">3GPP</a>などの標準化活動への関与があります。
これらの国際標準の仕様書では内容とその記述の困難さのため、それらを理解することは決して簡単ではないという特徴があります。
しかし、3GPPへの長年の関与を通じて標準仕様書作成に関する深い洞察と知識を身につけた結果、これらの標準規格の仕様書を比較的素早く理解することところまでになりました。
  </p>
  <p>これとは別に、様々な国や文化圏で働き、異なる文化的背景を持つ多くの国々出身の（元）同僚たちと接した経験こそが、私にとって最も重要で貴重な無形資産となりました。
比較的最近になって、博士号の取得を決意し、無事にやり終えました。現在は大学で研究と教育活動を継続しています。
この企業とは違った環境での経験は、私にまた新たな視点を与えてる結果となりました。

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">学歴</h2>
  <p>
    私の学歴と職歴は結果としてとても入り組んだものになってしまいました（上記の<a href="#work_history_experience_fig-jp">図</a>を参照ください）。
    意図的にそうしたわけではありませんが、社会人になってから勉強の重要性に気が付き、勉強のやり直しをしてきた結果としてそうなってしまったということです。
    言ってみれば社会人になってからずっと勉強のやり直しをしてきたといえると思います。
    このようなやり方は決してお勧めはできませんが、個人的にはやり切れた感があり、それには満足しています。

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">研究分野</h2>
  <p>私の研究分野は主に通信システムのセキュリティーです。
    自動車通信（V2X）は通信業界と自動車業界の融合する分野であり、研究分野としては面白い分野であると思います。
    この新技術がどのような成果を収めるのかというところに興味があり、今後もこの点を見極めたいと考えています。
  </p>
  <p>
    2023年にベルギーのルーベンカトリック大学に於いてPhDを取得しました。
    博士論文は自動車通信におけるセキュリティーおよびプライバシー保護に関するもので、主に国際標準の仕様書の分析に関するものです。
  </p>

  <p><strong>研究内容:</strong></p>
  <ul class="wp-block-list">
  	<li>自動車通信(V2X)と協調・接続型自動モビリティー(CCAM)を含む通信システムのセキュリティーおよびプライバシー保護。</li>
